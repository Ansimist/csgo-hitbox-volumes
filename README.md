This program calculates hitbox volumes based on qc files.
To use it, just drop the folder with qc files to the program located in “..\bin\release\”
For demonstration / tests, you can use existing files in the “..\examples\” folder. These are default qc files decompiled from CS:GO models by using Crowbar.
By using this program I was able to find out that the players’ head hitboxes can differ up to 16.75%.

Here’s google spreadsheet with my final calculations: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jcZq74D_YZy5Yy0yzQQwIF67bC8cUXto
